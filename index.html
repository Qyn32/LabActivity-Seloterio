        <h1>Sleep Well</h1>
        <h2>by d4vd</h2>
        <p>[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>Do you think about me every night?<br>
        Before you go to sleep (Yeah)<br>
        I know you must be terrified<br>
        Of what you might see in your dreams, but</p>
        
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>I'm here for you still<br>
        And even if you don't think that I'm near<br>
        I'll still be right next to you, my dear (Hmm)<br>
        And the way you make me feel<br>
        Has the power to make the whole world stand still<br>
        Who's to say that our love ain't real? (Hmm)</p>
        
        <p>[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>And I know I'm not the perfect guy<br>
        But I think I'm doing just alright<br>
        It doesn't matter what you thought of me then<br>
        But what you think of me now<br>
        We haven't always seen eye to eye<br>
        But right now, won't you look at mine<br>
        Don't be scared, there's no such thing as fear<br>
        When you sleep, just know that</p>
        
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>I'm here for you still<br>
        And even if you don't think that I'm near<br>
        I'll still be right next to you, my dear (Hmm)<br>
        And the way you make me feel<br>
        Has the power to make the whole world stand still<br>
        Who's to say that our love ain't real?</p>
